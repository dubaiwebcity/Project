        It should come as no surprise that the lifestyle you lead directly affects your fertility. From making healthy lifestyle choices to supplementing your intake of important nutrients, there are many things you can do outside of the clinic to improve and maintain your chances of becoming pregnant.
        Whether you are in the beginning stages of family planning or are currently seeking assistance from a fertility clinic, simple lifestyle adjustments and extra daily supplements can promote fertility.
        There are several important changes you and your partner can make before and during fertility treatments to increase the chance of successful conception. We recommend making these lifestyle modifications if you are considering becoming pregnant.

        <strong>​ALCOHOL</strong><br />Avoid alcohol use. Alcohol has been shown to cause birth defects in fetuses. In addition, patients who drink have a decrease in fertility rates, particularly with IVF and miscarriage rates have been shown to double compared to those who don’t drink alcohol. This has also similar effect on your husband.<br /><br />
        <strong>SMOKING</strong><br />Stop smoking and stay away from anyone who is smoking. Smoking has been implicated in infertility and earlier menopause. Smoking reduces success with IVF by about 50% and passive smoking has similar effects. This has also similar effect on your husband.<br /><br />
        <strong>DRUGS AND MEDICATIONS</strong> <br />Stop recreational drugs and unnecessary medications. Please stop all medically unnecessary drugs prior to attempting pregnancy. If you are taking medications prescribed by another physician, please let us know so we can determine if the medications are safe to take when trying to conceive and during pregnancy. This goes for your partner as well.<br /><br />
        <strong>PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT LOSS</strong> <br />Increase physical activity and lose weight if necessary. If you are overweight, it is a good idea to lose weight before trying to conceive. We encourage you to be physically active and to get your body into the best shape you can. In one study, obese women who exercised regularly had a three times higher chance of success with IVF. Women who are not obese should avoid strenuous exercise. Any level appears to be helpful for obese women.<br /><br />
        <strong>Exercise for Enhancing Fertility</strong> <br />A healthy lifestyle where exercise is routine aids in successful conception in both men and women. Choose a moderate and consistent exercise routine that you can stick with. Since strenuous exercise can have a negative impact on achieving a successful pregnancy for the female. Moderate aerobic activities are advisable. Exercise enough to raise your heart rate, which decreases oxidative stress and increases blood flow without fully taxing your body.

        Changing your diet can increase your fertility and can positively affect your chances of becoming pregnant. There are several foods you can add or remove from your diet that can impact your overall chances of becoming pregnant.<br /><br />
        <strong>THINGS TO EAT AND THINGS TO AVOID</strong><br />
        We recommend reducing red meat intake, eliminating Trans fats (such as donuts, pastries and all fried foods), and ensuring that at least 50% of every meal is composed of fruits and vegetables. Use olive oil for bread, dressings and cooking. It’s high in monounsaturated fat, which may be beneficial for women undergoing IVF treatment, and is good for general health. Reducing sugar intake is always a good idea.<br />
        Overcooking foods should be avoided.<br />
        Many delicious foods are high in antioxidants and should be incorporated into your regular diet. Here are some other popular foods that have naturally high antioxidant content:

      Drinking daily green tea also increases antioxidant intake, however we do not recommend over one cup of decaffeinated green tea per day because the caffeine could interfere with fertility. Green tea is minimally processed, which maintains its healthy properties. Though the decaffeination process does reduce the antioxidant content, simply adding 50mg of liquid Vitamin C to each cup of decaffeinated green tea can significantly increase your antioxidant intake.<br /><br />
      <strong>CAFFEINE </strong>
      <br />
      Excessive consumption of caffeinated products by the female, such as coffee, tea, colas, and chocolate may decrease fertility, although studies are conflicting. To be cautious, limit intake to a minimum. A maximum of one cup per day is advised. Caffeine is not harmful for the male partner’s fertility. <br /> <br />

       A variety of factors can impact fertility in women and men. Generally speaking, it is recommended that a woman under 35 who has been trying to get pregnant for a year, or a woman over 35 who has been trying for six months, consult with a fertility specialist to determine the best course of action. Women who have had more than three recurrent miscarriages should also seek the care of a specialist. Many women who have had miscarriages go on to have healthy pregnancies, but it could signal a fertility problem. Keep in mind that infertility issues are common, one in eight couples have trouble conceiving.<br />
       Female infertility is quite common, which is not surprising given the complex set of the normal events that must occur in order to give birth. Female infertility factors contribute to approximately 40% of all infertility cases. Normally, a woman’s body must:

      We believe that every woman needs the facts about her biological clock. Start here to learn more about fertility age and how time really affects your ability to have a healthy baby.<br /><br />
      Not every egg leads to a baby, no matter how young you are. It’s a common misconception that we have a 100% chance of pregnancy each time we ovulate (i.e., each month). Because a certain percentage of our eggs are abnormal at any age, and because fertilization has to happen within a narrow window after ovulation occurs, even a young, healthy woman trying to get pregnant has only about a 20% chance each month.<br /><br />
      Fertility goes into a sharper decline around age of 35 – over 10 years before reaching menopause.

        As women, our reproductive life begins when we get our first period, usually around age 12 (puberty), and lasts until our last menstrual period, usually around age 52 (menopause). But because egg count (ovarian reserve) and egg quality decline as we age, we don’t remain fertile for the entirety of this timespan.<br /><br />
        Women under the age of 35 have about a 20% chance of getting pregnant naturally each cycle. By the age of 40, the chance of getting pregnant naturally each month is just 5%. After that, natural conception declines faster.<br /><br />
        In fact, statistics from scientific research for women undergoing In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) shows that pregnancy rate also declines with advanced age. IVF pregnancy rate in women below the age of 35 may range from 40-50% and it decreases to 30% by age of 40 and it declines even more after age of 43 to less than 5%.<br /><br />
        As you age, the DNA inside your eggs begins to degrade. Because your eggs have been with you since before you were born, they are exposed to all sorts of damaging, but mostly unavoidable, influences throughout our lives: fevers, infections, stress, toxins, and free radicals. Because eggs are fragile and easily damaged, this exposure can lead to chromosomal abnormalities which affects their abilities to produce normal embryos ready for implantation and occurrence of pregnancy.<br /><br />
        There is no test for egg quality. The only way to know if an egg is chromosomally normal is to attempt to fertilize it outside the body, and, if fertilization is successful, to perform a genetic test on the embryo. But because damage to our DNA happens naturally and inevitably over time, your age can give a fairly accurate picture of what percentage of your eggs are normal.<br /><br />
        This is a fact<br /><br />
        Because age directly correlates with egg quality, and therefore the ability of the egg to fertilize into a healthy pregnancy, it’s the age of the egg that matters most when it comes to fertility. Seeking help for fertility treatment at younger age makes it much more meaningful.<br />

      Ovulation is the release of an egg from the ovary. This must happen in order to achieve pregnancy naturally. If ovulation is irregular, but not completely absent, this is called oligoovulation. Complete absence of ovulation is called anovulation. Ovulatory dysfunction is a common cause of female infertility, occurring in up to 40 percent of infertile women.<br /><br />
       Usually, women with ovulatory dysfunction will have irregular periods. In the worst case, they may not get their cycles at all. If your cycle occurs shorter than 21 days, or longer than 36 days, you may have ovulatory dysfunction. If your cycles fall within the normal range of 21 to 36 days, but the length of your cycles blood flow varies widely from month to month, that may also be a sign of ovulatory dysfunction.

        The main complication of endometriosis is impaired fertility. Endometriosis may obstruct the tube and prevent the egg and sperm to meet. But the condition also affects fertility indirectly like damaging the sperm or egg. The lining of the uterus is also affected indirectly by endometriosis by interfering with embryo implantation.<br /><br />
        Important issues<br /><br />
        Although, many women with mild to moderate endometriosis can still conceive and carry a pregnancy to term, fertility physicians advise women with endometriosis not to delay having children because the condition may worsen with time.
        One important issue for women who are known to have endometriosis and difficulty in conceiving is consult as early as possible a fertility expert to discuss her management plan and treatment options since her ovarian reserve may worsen faster than usual compared to other women without endometriosis.

They can be located in the wall of the uterus, on the outside surface of the uterus or within the uterine cavity.<br /><br />
     Most fibroids start as very small lesions and they can grow to large size.<br />

       Fibroids, even large ones, can occur without producing any symptoms at all. However, they can also cause a variety of symptoms depending on their size and location. The most common symptoms are heavy menstrual bleeding accompanied by menstrual pain if fibroid is protruding into the uterine cavity. Some fibroids are large and causing pressure symptoms on the adjacent organs like bladder or colon, pain with deep penetration during sexual intercourse, bladder irritability, rectal pressure, constipation and painful bowel movements.<br /><br />
       Effect of uterine fibroids on fertility<br /><br />
       Most uterine fibroids don’t affect fertility, only those fibroids that protrude into the uterine cavity affect fertility. Exceptions include large intramural fibroids that block the openings of the fallopian tubes into the uterus.<br /><br />
       The diagnosis<br /><br />
       The diagnosis can be easily made by ultrasound examination of the pelvis. However, sometimes it is difficult to tell if the fibroid is affecting the uterine cavity. Therefore, many women seeking fertility treatment need to make sure that the uterine cavity is intact if the ultrasound examination is inconclusive. To make sure that the uterine cavity is intact, a minor procedure called hysteroscopy is recommended.<br /><br />
       Most women are advised to surgically remove the affected fibroid. However, there are other non-surgical treatments that are either not effective or relatively more harmful than surgery.<br />
       If you suffer infertility and fibroid, fertility experts are the best physicians to consult. They, often, discuss informed choices and which surgical intervention works better for your condition.

      "Recurrent Miscarriage": {
      text: `
     Recurrent miscarriage is defined as the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies in the first few months of gestation. Generally, the risk of miscarriage in any given pregnancy is about 15-20%. Following three consecutive miscarriages, the risk of further miscarriage is about 40%. Furthermore, women may develop recurrent miscarriage after a successful pregnancy.<br /><br />
     Recurrent miscarriage often leaves patients feeling disheartened and frustrated about their situations and more stressful if it is combined with infertility. Both infertility and recurrent miscarriage may have overlapping causative factors.<br /><br />
     Causes of recurrent miscarriages may include:

       Accurate history and relevant investigations may identify factors contributing to recurrent miscarriage and help in the treatment plan of future pregnancy. Treatment is suggested according to the cause or possible cause of recurrent miscarriage.<br /><br />
       Losing a pregnancy can make you worry, wondering if you will ever be able to get pregnant again or have a healthy baby. You may even be asking yourself if you did something wrong or could have prevented this somehow. 50% of all miscarriages, the cause is never determined. But on the bright side, most women who experience one or several miscarriages will ultimately go on to have healthy babies.

     Recurrent IVF failure is defined when a patient undergoes multiple cycles of embryo transfer without resulting pregnancy. This is one of the most frustrating and stressful conditions for both patient and physician.<br /><br />
     Several reasons may explain failed implantation. It could be due to the embryo or endometrium or both. Other co-factors may be involved. However, in many cases we cannot explain the reason for recurrent IVF failure.<br /><br />
