      text: `
        Ovulation Induction is usually one of the first treatment options utilized if a woman is struggling to conceive. 
        It is the process of stimulating ovulation by using medications. Women who do not ovulate regularly are good candidates for this type of treatment. 
        Induction of ovulation with gonadotropins requires a patient and physician commitment.<br /><br />
        The injectable drugs are hormones that your pituitary gland normally produces. Although FSH is the hormone primarily responsible for follicular development, 
        both FSH and LH play a role in the normal development and ovulation of ovarian follicles. LH is normally responsible for triggering ovulation when a mature follicle is present.<br />
        Each of these drugs acts directly on the ovaries and do not have activities elsewhere in the body. Example:

        <strong> Menopur</strong>  is given subcutaneously. Menopur comes in ampule (75 ‚Äì 600 ‚Äì 1200 IU).<br /><br />
        <strong> Merional</strong>  is given intramuscular or subcutaneously. Merional comes in ampule (75 ‚Äì 150 IU).<br /><br />
        <strong> Menogon</strong>  is given intramuscular or subcutaneously. Merional comes in ampule (75 IU).<br />
        HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin): Its action is to trigger the final maturation of the egg and ovulation. Examples: <br />
        Pregnyl‚ÄìChoriomon‚ÄìChoragon (5000 ‚Äì 10000 IU) is given intramuscularly.<br />
        Ovidrel-Ovitrelle (250 ¬µg) is given subcutaneously.<br /><br />
        <strong> Indications for Treatment</strong>  In women who do not ovulate on their own (anovulation) like cases of Polycystic Ovaries.

        These drugs are used to produce more follicles in the ovaries in a controlled fashion and are used alone or in combination with tablets like Clomid and others. 
        For most women, any of the above mentioned drugs may be appropriate to use. However, in certain situations, one drug may be more advantageous to you.

        Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) is a procedure used to assist patients in achieving a pregnancy. This procedure involves ovulation induction using tablets and injectable drugs until mature follicles develop then HCG injection is given to trigger final egg maturation and ovulation. Then, within 12-36 hours after HCG injection, the husband will be asked to produce a semen sample.<br /><br />
        The sample will be processed by our lab through a ‚Äúsperm wash‚Äù technique that separates mobile sperm from non-mobile sperm and other cellular debris present in the ejaculate. Most of the fluid will also be washed off, resulting in a highly concentrated specimen of sperm. Within an hour or two of semen preparation your doctor will use a small catheter to place the washed sperms into the uterus. This process

      As we all know, it is ultimately Allah‚Äôs will to get pregnant with the gender you desire. That is, if you are destined to have it, you will have it, and the opposite is absolutely true. We understand the desire to balance your family. We will do everything in our capacity, based on scientific evidence, to help you increase your chances of having a child of your desired gender.<br /><br />
      The swim-up method for gender selection is the separation of X and Y-sperm using a standard technique in which the isolated motile Y-sperm is used to be placed inside the uterus using the intrauterine insemination technique. This increases the chances of having more male or female sperm in the sample used to fertilize the eggs. The chance to get pregnant in a male is, approximately, 70%. There is still 30% chance this pregnancy will end up to be a female. This is because there is No sperm sorting method 100% accurate in sorting the sperm into male and female batches.<br /><br />

Translocations occur when fragments or pieces of a chromosome break off and rearrange onto a different chromosome or rearrange within itself.

Unbalanced translocations result in an individual having more or less chromosomal material, thus causing genetic defects.<br /><br />
      <strong>Aneuploidy</strong><br />
      Aneuploidy is a condition which involves a cell with an incorrect number of chromosomes‚Äîtoo many or too few. Chromosomes contain all genes and DNA; the building blocks of the body. Humans have 46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs. These include chromosomes 1 to 22 (the autosomes) and chromosomes X and Y (the sex chromosomes). During fertilization, an embryo receives 23 chromosomes from the sperm and 23 chromosomes from the egg to form either 46,XY (normal male) or 46,XX (normal female). Aneuploidy disorders do not typically run in families and can include Down syndrome, Trisomy 18, Trisomy 13 and Turner syndrome. Aneuploidy testing of preimplanted embryos can determine these chromosomal disorders in addition to the sex of the embryo before transferring them back to the uterus.<br /><br />

      PGS is performed as a part of a standard IVF cycle where multiple eggs are produced, retrieved from the ovaries and fertilized with the husband‚Äôs sperm in the Embryology Laboratory.

These cells are analyzed for the presence of chromosomal abnormalities that may contribute to failure of pregnancy. This sophisticated and technologically advanced testing attempts to identify embryos which are free of abnormalities and more able to achieve the patient‚Äôs goal of having a healthy baby.<br />
